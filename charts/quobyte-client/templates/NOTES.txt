Welcome to Quobyte :)

You just installed the Quobyte client on every node of your 
cluster (using a daemonset). 
If you also installed quobytes storage driver you are now able 
to use dynamically provisioned Quobyte storage:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: quobyte-csi
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 21Gi
  storageClassName: quobyte-rf3

```
